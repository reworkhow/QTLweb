CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,Learning the julia,done,again,Nothing
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,coding from scracth,it will be better if more things can be explained by drawing on blackboard instead of just speaking,more theory of mixed linear model,no else
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"detailed explain for julia code.   and, several TAs are very helpful.",Provinding materials before workshop could be helpful.,"comparison the efficiency through cross-validation for several prediction methods (i,e,, ssBR, ssGBLUP, Bayesain alphabets and other penelty methods)",Everything was so good....
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"It is interesting and relevant to many parts of animal breeding, and hands on coding is always the best way to learn how to best use a program.","I found that the leap between day 3 and day 4 topics was a bit much. It was difficult to understand the explanations of the different methods if you were only slightly familiar with the actual structures, and thus coding or fixing code for these was very difficult because you were not sure what the goal was to achieve, or how to adjust the code to achieve the goals.      A longer period of time to more in depth cover all the steps would be great, although it may not be feasible.",Calculating different types of breeding values and genetic effects within a trait,"Really enjoyed the course overall, and the teaching style. "
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,The structured way of teaching and the course material. This way I can look at the course material afterward & still understand what is about what topic. ,It might be better to do the course in 2 or 3 weeks. Start with theory and give the students some time to digest.   Hereby going more into programming and coding in Julia before getting to the hard part. Might help a lot of people to keep up.,More possibilities with Julia,Thanks for the nice week.   It was nice that we had some evening programs as well. This way I could speak to the other students in a more informal way and this was nice.
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,The knowledge and experience of the professor and TA,there is a need to clarify specifically the coding skills to take this sort of course. this is not for beginners!!! ,GxE interaction   how to deal with high throughput phenotypic information into the model   specifically a plant related course,"instead of start from the very basic, maybe with the previos experience you can develop a tutorial videos or short course videos that the students can take before hand"
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"I like TAs most. They are willing to help you and patient. Also, they understand the material well so their explanation are easy to understand.",Probably covering too many material. I would like to spend more time in Bayesian analysis instead of A inverse. ,"The theorem of the Bayesian regression method, including BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, BayesCpi.....","The speed of first three days is okay. However, the thursday and friday are covering too much material."
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"The choise of Julia as the programing lenguage, the selected topics and the explanation of them.","It would be great to sugest some background about matrix algebra and a basic level of programing. With that, the time for explaining matrix algebra will be reduced and spending in other topics.   Also will be great to think the algorithms in pseudocode and then apply with Julia",More about genomics and incorporation of them to the programs.,"Will be great to give the schedule before the registration, just to be prepared"
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"Helped in understanding MME, difference between GBLUP and ABLUP(PBLUP),  intuitive in understanding algorithm speed and constructing composite data structures, which is simple but requires strategy for deciding data structure's properties",Visualization of Convergence algorithms in iterative and bayesian approaches,Application of genomic prediction models to GWAS   ,Amazing workshop for intuitively understanding matrix algebra in combination with product delivering.
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,It is useful in terms of the theoretical part.,Slow down the speed about Bayesian Inference. Too much time on the A inverse derivation. Hope to explain the codes in the last two days more clearly.,No.,No.
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,I like that I learned how to use Jupyter and Julia.  It was also nice to get some understanding of the fundamentals for genomic prediction models.,"I would like to have most of the time focused on the conceptual part, not on the programming part.  Also, there were a lot of assumptions made about our understanding of the prerequisites.  I think it would be a lot better to have in-depth discussions about the background.  I wasn't able to follow a lot of the course since I did not get a rationale behind what I was doing.",I still would like a better understanding of the meaning of everything.  I think it was too fast with too many assumptions of previous knowledge.  Maybe it would be better to split the class to people with a math/statistics background and a molecular biology background since we come from very different fields and have different components we want out of the course.,"Maybe also have a better description on the exact goals of the course.  If you do not want to cover the conceptual part and stress the computational part, this should be very clear in the course description."
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"I learnt a very efficient language and in the process, learnt the programming of mixed linear model. Every topic is very well integrated with both learning goals.",I would like to have some prerequisite materials before class. The materials could describe the concepts that are included but will be explained in detail in the course. Could also be a more detailed outline of the course.,I would like to learn how to choose and improve the models based on data and different criteria.,TAs are very helpful. Both instructors are extremely patient when answering questions. It's a very welcoming learning environment.
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,Application of the julia language for plant and animal breeding!   Great materials provided through jupyter notebooks.,Maybe split it into 2 weeks.   The first one with a more detailed introduction to Julia and the second one more focused on the theory/implementation.,Maybe a continuation of this one with more complex models and application examples.,Overall it was a great week.   It is a lot of content to be fit in only 5 days.   But it was a good hands on experience and good starting point.
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,It's a good course. The theory behind solving mixed model equation has been well explained. It's very helpful for my research. ,I would like to have a little bit more background review on population genetics and quant genetics before going for programming.   It would be good to include one or several case studies in the course.,Whole genomic prediction with various established approaches.   Whole genomic prediction with multiple kernels.,No. 
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,It was really good! It seems to me that I learned a lot because I can see the knowledge I know as a new and more new perspective. Hao and Rohan friendly explanation and TA's assistant have given us many opportunities.   ,"like the Ignacy's workshop, one more week for basic of julia couse needed for me.",I would like to know the basic of Bayesian concept.   And also want practices for several prediction methods with julia code.,I love this workshop!!!!!!
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,I really liked the teaching approach that combined learning the theory of quantitative genetics and the direct translation of the equations in a programming language (Julia). Good balance between concepts and practice.    Really appreciated the help and knowledge of the TA's as well as social events (diner + outing) organized.,Suggestion to improve the course would be:   -   give a better overview on what will be achieved during the course (day by day) and provide all material (jupyter notebooks) on day1.    - spend more time on bayesian inference and go a bit faster on normal equations ..   ,Multi-trait / multi-environment association analysis,Great workshop !
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,I like working with the code. I like that each day is built on what was covered the previous day.,"I think it is hard to figure out what the code is doing when we are trying to quickly copy the code. It is also distracting when we have to go back through the code to try to figure out where we made a typo. Maybe next year, the code can be sent in advance, but we write commentary (e.g. #this line computes the number of columns in the design matrix) together during the workshop. I think if the code is going to link to other notebooks, all those notebooks should be uploaded at the same time.","It is hard to consider what topics should be covered next year, since the backgrounds of students vary so much. I think less of the elementary coding topics should be covered (e.g. for loops and while loops), but more attention should be given to the logic of genomic equations and the logic of how to implement these equations into code.","I don't think the farmer's market is a good group activity; it is very crowded. If people want to go, they will probably just want to go and buy stuff, rather than sitting around a bunch of children playing ball."
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"(1) excellent instructors with advanced background in both statistics and quantitative genetics, as well as hand-on experience with software of JWAS developing   (2)details about statistics and genetics underneath the codes and algorithms   (3) product-directed course with a clear end-goal    (4) pre-course development setting up documents communication allow efficient time in class   (5) updating documentation and communications along the class in Slack   (6) good TA:student ratio helps with students with diverse background and different entry levels   (7) good lecture:break ratio allow understanding of lecture and questions handling   (8) nice atmosphere in the classroom and off-class getting together including Tuesday dinner and Wednesday farmer market hanging out","(1) pre-course documents about lecture material and related background material general guide to allow students with diverse entry-level to prepare for the course;   (2) background and application lecture about Genome prediction in animal,plant and related field, and its role in contemporary techniques/workflows in terms of breeding, science and sequencing","(1) Whole-genome-sequencing related analysis algorithms and techniques, how to build them from scratch   (2) Unix programming    (3) population genetics most used stats, algorithms and corresponding programming",excellent workshop!! 
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,The course is very informative. The instructors and TAs are quite helpful.,"Allocation of time spending on different session seems can be improved. Some sessions may need more instructions than others, but we used less time to explain them. Also, the ""coding together"" idea is great, but sometimes it's a little bit hard to follow because of jumping back and forward within Jupyter.   ","I would suggest there should be a session help us go through the production version of JWAS package, including when should we use which module , the limitation of each module, and how to interoperate model outputs precisely. ","Overall, it's a good course. Thank you so much, Hao and Rohan."
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,It is really hands on to learn how to build and solve mixed models & estimate marker effects with Julia. I like the course except that I think the last two days of course was kind of intense,It would be better if there are more plant breeding examples,Estimating variance components by REML from scratch ,Overall I like the course and appreciate both instructors of the short course
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"I liked interacting with the people in the class. Given that I don't have an extensive background in matrix algebra or Bayesian statistics, after day 3 I was more or less completely lost and just worked on my own things. But, I still enjoying attending and meeting lots of new people! ","If you continue teaching the class with the same content and structure, I would provide the following info: (1) a list of recommended prerequisites to make sure more people with the appropriate background knowledge can attend the class, (2) a detailed description of what JWAS is and how taking the class will help you understand the package, (3) clearly state that the course is about teaching computational aspects of the package - not how to use the package",Practice using JWAS and understanding the limitations and benefits of the package. Perhaps provide several datasets or recommendation of dataset types that can be used for JWAS,"The course instructors are incredibly compassionate, positive, and supportive. Even though I honestly didn't understand  much of the content, I still enjoyed being in the class. You're TAs are incredibly knowledgeable and so helpful - I really appreciated Tianjing's insight especially, She did an incredible job first teaching herself the material and then explained the concepts to me and other people who only had grasp of the basics. You have a great research team - keep up the great work!"
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,Overall I like the course because I learned a lot. ,"1. As a TA, I think it would be better if I have the course material for day4&5 in advance. I reviewed materials for day 1&2&3 in advance, and I really helped students a lot. But in day4&5, I felt I don't have time to help my students because I need to understand materials first.   2. We spend 1 day on A inverse and I think it's too much. Just use inv(A) would be enough. Then we can use this day for Bayes.   3. Big picture should be given before any topic. For example, my student didn't know why they were learning A inverse. Maybe before the whole class, we should tell them what's the relationship of each topic.",Not sure yet,Thanks Hao and Rohan to provide such a good course. Thanks to all TA.
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"I really like that we get to build our own package 'miniJWAS' from scratch. This actually helps me understand the complexity underlying other public packages/software out there much better. I'm not saying I understand 100% of what we went over in the past week, but I enjoy it and feel quite proud to have come this far! ","1. It'll be super helpful to get to read/go over the lecture notes/codes before the classes. Seeing the codes for the first time and needing to understand them appeared to be quite pretty challenging in this past week.   2. I like that the TAs have been learning all these new materials at the same time as the participants. This helps them understand better what the students were struggling with. Still, I was also hoping the TAs be a bit more familiar with Julia and the codes in general to quickly assist us as needed in a timely manner.   3. Perhaps having more example data sets would be ideal, so that we get to really practice on a wide-range of examples.","1. More exercises. Either proof of concept, or practical application of the packages would be helpful.   2. Perhaps we can try using other packages on Julia, or other languages and compare them?   3. Collaborative small projects between students might be a good idea? Just to help engage students and ensure understanding of the subject matter.","Thank you so much for organizing the courses. Thanks to the instructors, the TAs, and all other supporting staffs. Please continue to keep the workshop affordable."
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,Statistical theory and examples combined with coding in julia.,Needs little bit more explanation regarding the basics of julia and the way of coding in julia,"Statistical approaches in association study between phenotype and SNP/CNV, indels etc","Thanks for such an interesting way of handling biostatistics using julia. Please provide some documentation with real examples on calculation and interpretation of of breeding value, genetic correlation, heritability estimation in half-sib, full-sib and regression methods"
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,"integrated programing implementation into GS theory, especially from scratch","reduce time you spend on A matrix and A inverse so that you have enough time to introduce some basic Bayesian analysis concepts before formally jumping into Bayesian Alphabet and MCMC. Rohan mentioned one thing very quickly, I'm not sure if everyone got it - the reason that we want to do MCMC is because the posterior distribution is usually a complex mathematical expression and hard to get the distribution parameters analytically, so you have to use random sample from the distribution for this purpose. I think it will be better if you introduce this before you discuss the Gibbs sampler and/or other sampling techniques.","many participants in this workshop are from the plant/animal breeding companies or students from other departments that usually do not provide intensive training on quantitative genetics and/or GS theories. this may be partly due to the fact that the class size is limited to 30 so many people that are interested in this course didn't have a chance to register. but I believe in addition to the GS theory and its computational implementation, there must be a big interest to the integration of GS methods into the currently widely used breeding programs/cycles. so you can consider adding this to the next workshop",the course is short and in-class exercises may not be enough to let people digest/understand the theory behind it. so it will be great if you can provide a suggested reading list so that people can understand it better even after the course ends
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,like it.,I think it's better to get lectures notes earlier and we can have time to read it and better to understand during class.,single step method,
CzhSJpoE3rDoQvCqD,yencFuEFagKxADdhW,,,6/28/19 8:36,#2019ucd,It was so helpful for me.   It is the first time to know the Bayesian concept and julia programming. So I am so happy.,It was nice workshop. But I think that it need more explaination for julia programming about one more week for beginner step.,I want to participate in the same course once more.,
